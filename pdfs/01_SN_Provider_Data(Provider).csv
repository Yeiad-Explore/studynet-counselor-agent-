Formed progressively through the merge of regional institutions in south-western and western NSW, CSU was formally incorporated on 19 July 1989 under the Charles Sturt University Act 1989. As one of Australia's newer universities, CSU has been built on a tradition of excellence in teaching and research spanning more than 100 years.

Charles Sturt University has a proud history and we are very fortunate to have an outstanding group of diverse, passionate and engaged people working with us. Each person's experience of CSU will be the sum of the ways in which we all behave - as co-workers, as professionals and as the 'faces' of our university. As a values driven organization, we all therefore have an important role to play in bringing our values to life and making them part of our daily lives. Underpinning our ethos, our four values are shown below.

Many students say one of the best parts of the university experience is living in a residence. Rarely will you have the chance to live in a community that has people from so many walks of life and countries. At Accommodation Services you will benefit from an environment committed to providing high academic achievement, involvement, development and fun.

All residences feature student development and peer mentor programs, social, sporting and cultural events, and 24/7 student well being care. Utilities, furniture, laundry, limited car parking, and environmentally responsible recycling programs are available at each residence.

(b)Live off campus:
(1)Rental - Rental or private accommodation is a great choice if you are looking for an independent lifestyle. There are some great places to live in Wollongong that are close to the university, shops, beaches and other attractions.

(2)Shared accommodation - Shared accommodation is a great idea if you want to live independently and want to meet new people. Share accommodation occurs when you either move into a house that is occupied by other people or you agree to rent a property with other people. Sharing a house with other people is a cost effective way to live because you share the costs of living with other people.

While shared accommodation is a great alternative to living by yourself, it can be complicated. You need to know exactly what you are looking for with your accommodation arrangements. There are some very important things you will need to consider when you are thinking about share accommodation.

(3)Short stays -  Temporary accommodation when you arrive so that you will be able to search for a suitable property.

The University's first Vice-Chancellor, Dr Augustus Short, had a vision for a university open to investigate new fields such as the sciences, modern literature, art and moral philosophy; This vision was realised in 1882 when the University became the first in Australia to grant degrees in science.

The spirit of enquiry was further embraced and the freedom to explore non classical subjects continued. Before reaching the 1900s the University offered degrees in arts, science, law, medicine and music. Additionally mathematics, philosophy, languages and mining engineering were taught. These flagship degrees and disciplines continue at the University today, with the curriculum evolving over time through input from industry, and the pioneering research and discovery for which Adelaide's academics are known.","Airport pickup and reception services
